            <p>This is my process journal for the university class DECO2200 - Interaction Design. Within this process journal, I talk about mine and my group's struggles, successes and fun which we had whilst researching, creating and testing different solutions for our problem area. The problem area my group and I chose to implement Autonomous Systems into was the Paramedic Industry, specifically around the Ambulance and transportation originally. Through extensive research, we discovered a lot about the paramedic industry which originally all of us knew very little about minus a class or two in Health at school but we learnt a lot about the problems both them and the patients face during an Ambulance and treatment that comes with it which is explained further on this page. From this, we created many ideas from the use of brainstorming and eventually refined done to two ideas (which became three at the end due to limitations found along the way) which we proceeded to test and refine till the final product our high fidelity was created. The journal provides insight into the whole process that was undertaken.

            <p>We had a general brief for assessment 1 that we each individually worked on to get us started with our research and picking of the topic. The outline of the brief was to create an interactive display for an autonomous vehicle, drone or device that could improve something in the next 10 years. It was an extremely flexible brief that enabled us to choose any area as long as the autonomous part was included. We originally went with children’s education and night time commuting safety but in the end, we chose something we all became passionate about Paramedic services. I believe that having discussed shared passion areas and problems and using this to hone into our chosen paramedic industry area improved our team’s motivation and work ethic. This was able to help us, as a team, further brainstorm our design space, and set a clearer design goal to achieve. Our objective is mind was to hopefully provide a better service for both parties, whilst improving overall chances at saving lives.

            <p>To begin our research each of us design user research methods to enable us to learn from the users of paramedics services and paramedics themselves. Through the use of interviews and surveys to gather data and insights into the industry we learnt many key issues that became the basis for our series of brainstorms that generally highlighted some of the ways we could help them using autonomous vehicles and then listing out features we believe to be potential solutions to the users pain points (found through our research).

            <p>Some of the concepts above were drawn out from the collection of features, wants and needs of users whom we had researched on and gathered data on. Our team had a bit of difficulty discovering a lot of paramedics with time free on our hands (SPOILER ALERT: This is a huge limitation in Part 2) but we gathered enough insights to create a few key problem areas and a few features we wished to explore in our concepts. We were able to eventually come up with insightful findings through sketching out some types of equipment that paramedics have to use and brainstorming all our ideas out. This mapping technique was able to help me, and my team, better bounce off ideas. For me, this technique was able to make me realise more key concepts and problems, as I was able to visually see what my other team members were thinking and were then able to make links to certain triggering concepts. The key problem areas included:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Long distances and hard to reach places such a outback, forests or even tops of buildings. Interview with Paramedics stated that long distances and places </li>
              <li>Dangerous situations like sieges, fires and other natural disasters that are dangerous to access and operate within for the paramedic</li>
              <li>Overall improvement of the treatment and diagnosing of patients (better equipment and faster diagnosing of the patient)</li>
              <li>How to save valuable time in transit (everyone knows traffic sucks a lot already)</li>

            <p>After collecting and merging all our data and putting it next to our brainstorms we created 5 ideas. These 5 ideas all tackled the issues we discovered in different ways whilst ensuring the autonomous component of the task was still met. We knew through our tutor’s advice that we had to cut down to 2 ideas (which funnily later due to necessity led to the recreation of a third but that is for a later part). We struggled intensely to cut down to 2, so we began sketching our concepts out. Originally our 5 ideas were:</p>

            <p>Out of this 3 stood out above all of them. Our team was torn choosing between them so we asked Ashlyn (our tutor) to provide us feedback and the 3 concepts we liked the most did receive good compliments overall - with obviously a lot of improvements needed, but in the end, it only made us like the 3 more. So we decided to further expand on the three with concept sketches to try and explain what it would do and further iteration or the features and everything it could have. We still had not yet reached the creation of the first low fidelity screens, but we did now have an excellent idea of the main 3 ideas. They were:

              <h2>Concept 1: Zone Drone</h2>
              <img src="./img/common/zdrone.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>Drones are stationed at designated zones for faster response times. Each individual zone (e.g. a suburb, national park or a certain area), would be allocated to a drone, which will help with responding to emergency situations. They will provide both surveillance and a medkit, with basic supplies, to hopefully stabilise the patient before the ambulance arrives. Some areas will have more condensed and smaller zones allocated to them (e.g. Sydney CBD itself may have 5 drone zones) based on population and demand.</p>
              <img src="./img/common/zdrone2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>The allocated ambulance will automatically connect to the drone that is being dispatched based on the zone of where the patient scenario is. This is seen in the attached diagram. By having access to the drone, this enables the paramedic team in the connected ambulance to see what the issue at hand is ahead of time. It can also provide basic diagnoses for issues before the paramedics arrive to the scene.</p>

              <h2>Concept 2: Autonomous Ambulance Drone</h2>
              <img src="./img/common/amDrone.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>The heli-drone concept essentially adds extra features to enhance the overall function of an ambulance to be able to get to natural disaster areas, hard to reach, dangerous or long distance destinations. 50% of participants in 1 of 3 of our user research surveys wanted more resources for environmental/natural disasters. Additionally, interviews with paramedics further highlight a more versatile way to deal with these kind of situations more effectively to be able to increase patient support. Hence, this concept attempts to solve this issue area. As the heli-drone autonomously flies itself to the patient, it would enable paramedics to focus on planning ahead and preparing during flight rather than spending large amounts of time and effort focusing on the transit to the patient. It also has a holistic overview scanner to inform paramedics of the patient’s condition with as much accuracy as possible.</p>

              <h2>Concept 3: Capsule Stretcher</h2>
              <img src="./img/common/stretcher.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
              <p>Ability to travel to designated locations by itself to retrieve a patient. It supplies basic medical resources and analyses vital signs to update medical team. This idea ended up becoming cut. Which is explained next paragraph, so not going to give to much detail about it as it was not super fleshed out.</p>

            <p>Now it was time to cut down to 2. This was really hard but in the end, due to the practical nature of the concepts, there was one outlier that we could not get it to fully fit out users needs (patient’s needs). The one we decided to cut was the Capsule Stretcher. Over we really like the “Cradle of Life” concept but it was not completely practical. It relied on the patient or bystander to understand the capsule stretcher and then them being able to move themselves/other onto it, to secure them. It didn’t provide the patients with the comfort given by the paramedics and it didn’t accommodate for serious injuries. No matter how many times we try to get the concept to work it didn’t sadly so we cut it from the three. </p>

            <p>This section explores the iterations of the Zone Drone and Ambulance Drone, along with our user and tutor feedback and how we used that to iterate the paper prototypes a second time. To start this part of creating screens we needed an easier way to look at what the interface should include with a target market, the device used and what should be added within the interface. We discovered this through mind mapping (who, what, when, where, why and how?), which enabled us to have a more rounded view on what the interface needs, who for and why. This helping us in our iterations greatly as it acted as an anchor for our designs. Note we tested our users throughout with 3 methods: </p>

              <p>Our first low fidelity gave us the foundation we needed to push the idea further. Key issues we found with the initial design was that the interface was not consistent which caused users to not understand flow, confusing buttons and icons and overall too cluttered with no ability to unclutter. This feedback from the tutor and other students I found really valuable as it broadens both my understanding around visual hierarchy on a system that contains really critical information and forced me to draw upon more design principles that I have learnt in my other class Principles of Design to help the group iterate further. From this, we began working on our prototypes ensuring we kept the ongoing feedback in mind. </p>

Also, we received negative reviews on the icons, so overall the navigation sadly was still an issue. This alongside our issue of not being able to test with the actual user Paramedics and not being experts in the field of paramedics we ended up scrapping this idea, as we found it was far too hard to correctly implement within the assessment timeframe. It was a shame but good designers know when to cut their losses and move on, which is explored more in Part 4.</p>

              <p>The low fidelity of the Ambulance drone was met with a lot more positivity than the Zone Drone interface. Overall the interface was a lot more simple and easier to navigate. The tutor provided us with some insights into how we can reshuffle the position of icons and some of the information to make more relevant information stand out over less useful pieces of information. Thankfully the consistency was overall good and we were not completely struggling to make the interface work.

                <p>  Our two initial chosen concepts had become fleshed out and were now bearing all the issues. With stress from our assessment criteria and the original words of our tutor about needing specific users, our paramedics, we had come up completely dry. With no way to legitimately test our group was starting to feel enormous strain, myself particularly. We required a way to get out of this hole and be able to test and achieve the application standard we wanted. So we decided to pivot on one of the existing ideas, Zone Drone and combine it with the Dr. Drone, then create it from a patient’s point of view rather than paramedics. This decision was then strongly ideated on and it soon became a strong potential concept in regards to its ability to address our current problem space, as well as being able to allow us to address our other key insights that were gained from user research. </p>

                <p>At this point, I realised that the Dr. Drone patient perspective concept could be further supported by my particular section of the user research. In my individual user research, my problem space ended up addressing more issues from a patient perspective. This allowed me to have tackled the patient’s experience, and hence I had access to some valuable information that could help to further enhance this third concept. One of the key things it tackled was the speed to treat the patient with their basic needs before the ambulance arrives (some participants in the survey and interviews for my report wanted painkillers ahead of time).</p>

                <p>The best part was we didn’t need to pivot our vision statement which though refined to paramedics originally, the Dr. Drone concept met it easily too, more as a two way street concept. If the bystander or patient is more active and able to potentially treat some of the incident and diagnose it better with the help of the Dr. Drone, paramedics lives would also become easier as they could focus on the larger and higher priority tasks at hand. So, in the end our third idea became the basis of the remainder of assessment 2 (medium fidelity) and then the chosen high fidelity concept for this assessment. </p>

                <p>Overall, the user testing for all three of our concepts allowed my team to gain a better understanding of our design direction, and how well our thought up concepts were actually able to directly help our users. The experience was eye-opening, and it made my team realise how complicated our 1st and 2nd concepts would be overall in the long-run (particularly with our limitation with the paramedics), which then lead to us working extremely hard to create something awesome for the new users (bystanders and patients). The motivation we gained once we had more control on the testing was amazing and the team did an excellent job to create a great medium fidelity after all the issues faced in this section, that tested our new concept really well.</p>
                <p>We all quickly became very excited and passionate (once more) about our third concept and that leads us into the 5th section - part 5: the rebuilding of a fallen assessment!

Our team is on a role and working hard to make the medium is best a possible to test to have as much insights as possible for next assessment. On top of this our team is working long hours to make up for lost time and really knuckling down on the report (which ended up being huge! Took ages!) due to the suggestion from Ashlyn to make a long report due to our lack of primary users to make up for lost marks. It was a hectic time with multiple days of really long hours but in the end we got our testing and report done earlier than expected (we thought it might be a 10 mins before due date report). </p>

                <p>The major reasons we ended up choosing this concept of the Dr. Drone was because even though we knew the interaction was not for the paramedics we still felt it was more useful for them, than the other 2 concepts. This plus the added bonus of helping the patient ahead of time was a winning idea in our mind. We used heuristic testing to display how this solution trumped the others and on top of that we noted that the users needs for both parties were being met in a more holistic and beneficial manner for both parties. We were sold. So we build our medium fidelity ensuring the visual hierarchy was well done (showing critical information better than other concepts and low fidelity), the overall application was simple and easy to use and the understanding of what the app does was well portrayed. </p>
                <p>Our key findings and insights in testing this section using bodystorming as our testing method were:</p>

                  <li>One of the participants picked up the phone after the other to say out loud how to help the patient, because they were less confident</li>

                  <li>The simple instructions and support that the app gives to its users seemed to successfully be able to empower them to be more resourceful.

                <p>The reason why we chose bodystorming though was because in the past iterations we did think-aloud, user testing and post structure interviews as the major methods, but that was limited as none of the users were paramedics. With concept 3 however we got the chance to properly test our application. My team and I came together to talk about the best way to test it and make up for lost time and we ended up deciding on bodystorming, which enabled us to test our interface in a simulated stressful situation with users and have them basically pull apart the application in attempt to save the patient (another user). It was a fun method and overall gave really helpful insights as seen above. Some of these insights could not be found out without having multiple people trying it at once in a simulated moment. Overall for this part we were extremely happy with how the pivot turned out and are excited to work on the next part, the High Fidelity Mockups.</p>

                <p>This is the final section of our project’s journey, thank goodness. Up until this point it has been extremely hectic, with non stop challenges in terms of finding users, us trying to make an application that we are not experts in and overall, to be honest for the first two concepts, a lot of bad reviews and issues. This all lead to this point though. Our team and I created our first high fidelity screen. It’s layout was based off android (more subconsciously though) and was only really making the medium fidelity become high fidelity. Testing displayed this as they said it still felt like it was lacking the high fidelity feel and our tutor remarked that is was not an actual “high fidelity”. We got some insight also off Ashlyn about potentially improving our application by basing it off real world applications more and tying in the key design criterias of an iOS phone rather than a Android. This feedback was excellent and I am extremely grateful that we took it’s advice, as Victoria, our only member with an iPhone was quickly able to adapt it to the iOS format (and did an awesome job).

                <p>Our objective after making the user flow more like a iOS was to make it really feel like it was a high quality product rather than a cheap medium almost high fidelity! We greatly improved the visuals, improving both colour scheme and visual hierarchy. We adapted the phone to properly fit an iPhone X screen on invision whilst ensuring the top info bar was not interrupting our design (we didn’t realise this till first test upload where our created top iPhone info bar clashed with invisions built in one) and aimed to improve the overall understanding of what the app does with more screens to show transitions. We now created a Version 2 which we were all extremely proud of!

                <p>Overall, we need a better icon and menu at the bottom to allow users to be able to bring up the important information at their disposal. We also realised that once the user typed in their enquiry and started to look at various articles of possible solutions, they weren’t actually able to get back to the search bar to type in another enquiry. This along with some other hiccups and glitches in screen changes we aimed to make it even better in the final iteration. Other issues we discovered was that some people found the text a bit too intimidating, given the situation, the amount of it was overwhelming and will need to be refined. So along came Version 3.
                </p>
                <p>We were now all equipped to better improve our current designs, which is where our version 3 came in! We focused a lot on enhancing the aesthetics, as most of our visual information layout had now all been sorted. We all really enjoyed this final part of improving the aesthetics, and we finally all had chosen a gradient colour scheme, which we all liked. The bottom nav bar was refined and text made more clean. We added some additional screens to improve flow and make more of the buttons work as they hit dead ends due to lack of screen to follow them (we forgot one). Overall we love the final look and I am super proud of us.

                <p>In conclusion, we went through a tough time, particularly in our medium fidelity stage. We went through a lot of highs and a lot of lows together, but it seemed worth it in the end and I’m so glad that we overcame all the obstacles together. I learnt a lot and that was the main thing. Also, thanks for being a great tutor Ashlyn! </p>
