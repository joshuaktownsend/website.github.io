                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p>As a general overview, our initial approach going into this first iteration of our high fidelity, ‘Dr. Drone App’, was with the aimed direction of keeping the interface design simple and plain. This decision was majorly influenced from our key feedbacks from prior various fidelity versions of our 3 main concepts (in which we noticed a trend in solid plain colours for emergency apps due to the critical importance of directing users’ attention to the written content and displayed information).
                </p>
                <p>We will be conducting the user testing through co-discovery and think-aloud methods. Co-discovery was used alongside individual tests, where we put two participants of different age and experience together and made them think-aloud. Think aloud is easy to do as it doesn’t require a lot preparing, it gives us an idea of what the user’s mental model is and we are able to measure the satisfaction of users using the design. Participants will be given tasks to complete using the given prototype while speaking out their thoughts. As the think aloud and co-discovery will be done together with other participant, users will feel more comfortable and relaxed, increasing the validity, and will be able to get transparent emotions as participants will less likely to feel awkward or embarrassed. </p>
                <h2>What are we testing:</h2>
                <p>We will be testing the usability of the app, particularly in regards to how easy it is for our users to understand each screen, navigate through them, and carry out the end task of efficient delivery of fast service to their location. The overall experience we wanted our users to go through was to feel in control, empowered and less stressed knowing that quick effective help was coming to them. We wanted to also test the overall layout of our designs, and whether this was both informative but not too noisy.</p>
                <h2>Who did you test with:</h2>
                <p>We carried out our user testing with the general public, setting two scenarios for them to play out: seeking medical advice for a stomach ache, and an emergency situation where they needed to call for the arrival of help. Overall, we had 6 people of different age groups, backgrounds and occupations testing our service through all 3 of our iterations. But for this first version, we also had an addition of a studio tutor to give us feedback on her experience and interactions. </p>
                <h2>Where and how did you test:</h2>
                <p> We used two methods to conduct our user testing:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Think aloud</li>
                  <li>Co-discovery</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We conducted it using invision studio to map out real life interactions of our app design, and hence we were able to host the test on our phones to replicate a real life situation. Our tests were conducted in random locations depending on where our users were, as we emphasised on the use of role-playing.

                <h2>Invision Embedded Demo</h2>
                <p>This embedded demo is our first attempts at getting our head around the high fidelity look and feel of the interface. Version 1 of the application explored how our screens and interactions with the concept would work on Android Operating System. Though we pivoted away from this (to an iOS style application) due to the user testing results and some of our tutors advice we leveraged it as an excellent learning opportunity. </p>

              <div class="col-md-8">
                <h2>Results:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>Although it was understood and appreciated regarding the simple clean presentation, it lacked to portray the considered look of a finished high fidelity appearance. </li>
                  <li>The continued theme of plain solid colours actually seemed to decrease the quality of the user experience, in which it was observed that a lot of confusion and stress occurred when users were placed in a pretend emergency scenario. When we further enquired into why they seemed to appear this way, the users generally responded that the use of dark colours actually contributed to an increasing feeling of panic and contributed to the feeling of bothersome regarding having to read the instructions. </li>
                  <li>The flow of the application did not correctly represent real world application so some people found it hard to use and expected certain things to work when they didn’t. Example: after confiding with a tutor about display, we still tested the “android version” (seen to act more like an Android phone interface) and a majority of people with iOS found it difficult to use. </li>
                  <li>Our tutor provided valuable feedback on what should be shown on the screen at certain points during the applications use, example when in emergency call you don’t need to show home button at all. We implemented this factor in our second version of the High Fidelity Mockup.</li>
                  <li>Some of the screen transitions were a little confusing and required to be improved to ensure the user understands how they can and just interacted with that given interaction, whether it is a swiping action or just a timed screen change. </li>
                  <li>By running through the process of interaction during user testing, we discovered from our users about a potential issue regarding the confirmation of if the Dr. Drone and Ambulance have arrived. It was noted that if the app told the patient/bystander that the drone or ambulance had arrived, what would happen if the patient/bystander physically cannot see the arrival of the vehicles? </li>
                  <li>The menu icons were too close and need to be spaced out better to ensure less mistakes are made in pressing on top nav buttons. </li>
                  <li>Users + Ashlyn said the aesthetics of the high fidelity was a little off, giving it a fake or gimmicky kind of feel. Ashlyn noted it was as if it was still partly in the medium fidelity range.</li>
                </ul>
              </div>
              <div class="col-md-4">
                <h2>Recomendations</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>In the end, we pivoted to a more iOS style interface, which we believed had a much clearer and have a better flow than the original high-fidelity design.</li>
                  <li>With the help of Ashlyn’s advice, we implemented the change of making the screens during the call have fewer options on them, which reduces the noise of the design and improves clarity and hierarchy of importance. </li>
                  <li>Added in an error option for the proposed scenario of not being able to physically spot the drone, which will be able to further empower our main users and increase confidence and accurate arrival of help. </li>
                  <li>Users discovered potential issues of - “what if the patient/bystander cannot see the arrival of the vehicles?”</li>
                  <li>Menu icons need to be more spread out to prevent mistakes in pressing on buttons</li>
                  <li>Tweak and fix up sections of the application that lack the navigation capabilities to go between screens failed. </li>

                <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                <p>Dr.Drone Version 2 is an updated and pivoted model from Dr.Drone Version 1. By considering the user testing results and recommendations, we will make our model more accurate, efficient, effective and easy to use under any circumstances. We aim to make sure the icons are spread out preventing mistakes on pressing the buttons, we will make the transitions between screens more smooth and natural and further improved on the aesthetical aspects of the design. We will be using the same user testing methods - co-discovery and think-aloud, and if more recommendations or suggestions are said from the participants, we will have to alter and improve our design.
                </p>
                <h2>What are we testing:</h2>
                <p>In this round, we will still be testing the usability of our app design in general and the success and efficiency of users to reach the end goal. As our aimed user experience for our app was not achieved in our user testing, we really needed to make sure our user testing would better enhance the user experience. Therefore, from the few adjustments we made from our first user testing, we iterated a new layout to be able to test a more desired user experience. </p>
                <h2>Who did you test with:</h2>
                <p>We carried out our user testing with the general public, setting two scenarios for them to play out: seeking medical advice for a stomach ache, and an emergency situation where they needed to call for the arrival of help. Overall, we had 6 people of different age groups, backgrounds and occupations testing our service. </p>
                <h2>Where and how did you test:</h2>
                <p> We used two methods to conduct our user testing:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Think aloud</li>
                  <li>Co-discovery</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We conducted it using invision studio to map out real life interactions of our app design, and hence we were able to host the test on our phones to replicate a real life situation.

                <p>Our embedded demo of version 2. This is most advanced version we have created yet.

Some sections are missing which we were not aware of earlier. Only once we clicked through it ourselves and had people test it did we notice our flaws. We tried to patch all of these out in version 3. Enjoy the click through!</p>

                <h2>Results:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>The asterisk icon in the menu bar did not intuitively represent its purpose, which made people curious on it and appear confused on what its function was → even after explanation, this confusion ultimately became enhanced as they still were confused on what to do with it. </li>
                  <li>The timed transition was too quick - the suddenness of the transition made people panic and attempt to go back to the original page in order to view the information again. </li>
                  <li>The way the prototype worked in the medical advice section had a screen become unusable,  that was due to unable to be reached if the user took the favourites first, they were unable to get back to the making an enquiry page. The enquires had no way to jump back to the making an enquiry page or the ability to retype the question which made the navigation and flow confusing, even though they completely understood the purpose.</li>
                  <li>Too much text, on the “are you sure you want to call?” screen, because after reading the information about what the app does they just wanted to rush into the emergency part. </li>
                  <li>The unsure option for the map was a little confusing - unsure more because almost all the user, half skipped the pop-up that said they needed to speak over the phone and describe the location. They wondered how it would find out.  </li>
                  <li>We forgot to have a screen to represent the change in location, so that was a little confusing for both us and the user when we realised it didn’t work… whoops!  </li>
                  <li>Also, a key insight was that the app overall had too much text in the emergency part as the individual doesn’t really have time to read all of it before the drone arrives due to its short flight time to the patient. He said it was unnecessary to have so much when the drone will soon take over from the application. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Recomendations</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>The recommendation is to either completely cut out the asterisk and not have in the bottom navigation bar OR write home under it and have it take you back to the home screen where you make the choice between  </li>
                <li>We need to go back and properly adjust the timing effects regarding certain screen transitions, in order to simulate a more real-life situation scenario and allow people to have time to process the information and not panic.  </li>
                <li>To allow users to be able to go back to the enquiry page to type in a new enquiry, we could either fix the back button to direct users back to the main enquiry page rather than going back to the emergency option page, or we could add in a button/signifier that allows users to understand to press it in order to go back to the general enquiry page </li>
                <li>Create a change page for the location that is simple to understand, the user will have to type their location or drag the pin to their location. </li>
                <li>Too much text issue for the call option page - a majority generally stated that we should just make it, “Are you sure?”, as no one has time to read unnecessary long-winded information.  </li>
                <li>Too much text in the emergency part - we could divert the instructions sent from paramedics into a more visual based cue rather than text-based. And instead of having a pop up with a long description that the drone has arrived, we are thinking of heading into the direction of using more visual cues. I.e. having the drone icon pulse on the map when it has arrived, with a small pop up announcing to confirm its arrival.  </li>

            <h2>Overall comments of our final look!</h2>
            <p>The final version of Dr.Drone implemented the majority of the suggestions and recommendations from previous versions of user testing. </p>
            <p>Further testing of the usability of our app with the feedbacks from previously conducted testings has influenced this final design of our app. These iterations are aimed at increasing the overall comfort level of our users in using our app. For example, our specific visual iterations, including a more professional and calming colour scheme, was tested to increase comfort and familiarity with interacting with the app. The aim of the improved gradient colour scheme was also implemented to further enhance the user’s intuitions with interacting with our app in a real-life 3D space. Iterations of our icons and sticky bottom menu add to the overall changing aesthetics and easier user intuitive navigation. The overall navigation of the app has been enhanced to be easy enough for our users to recall information rather than have to remember the information.  </p>
